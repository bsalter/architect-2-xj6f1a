I want you to build a simple application that has a view table (called a "Finder") and an add/edit page for the items in that table.

The entity of the view and add/edit page is an Interaction. An Interaction consists of a title, a type, a lead, start date/time, timezone, end date/time, a location, a description, and notes.

Display these fields in the Finder, and make the Finder searchable on those fields.

Create a simple login/auth page. Interactions are scoped to sites, and a site can contain multiple users. Those users login using the login page.
