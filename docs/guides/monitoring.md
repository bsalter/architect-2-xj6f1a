# Monitoring Guide

This guide provides comprehensive information on the monitoring infrastructure for the Interaction Management System. It covers how to use dashboards, understand metrics and logs, configure alerts, respond to incidents, and troubleshoot issues using monitoring data.

## Monitoring Overview

The Interaction Management System employs a multi-layered monitoring approach to ensure reliability, performance, and security across all system components.

### Monitoring Architecture

The monitoring infrastructure is built on AWS CloudWatch with PagerDuty integration for alerting and incident management:

- **Metrics Collection**: System, application, database, and user activity metrics collected via CloudWatch agents and custom instrumentation
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralized collection of application, access, and security logs using structured JSON format with correlation IDs
- **Distributed Tracing**: Request tracking across components using correlation IDs
- **Alert Management**: Tiered alerting system with different urgency levels and response times
- **Dashboards**: Purpose-built dashboards for different stakeholders (operations, developers, management, security)

The monitoring architecture follows these data flows:

## Incident Response Process

The incident response process provides a structured approach to handling alerts and resolving issues.

### Alert Triage

When an alert is triggered, follow these steps to assess and prioritize:

1. **Acknowledge the alert** in PagerDuty to prevent escalation
2. **Assess severity** based on:
   - System impact (user-facing vs. internal)
   - Scope (isolated vs. system-wide)
   - Business criticality
3. **Check related metrics and logs** in CloudWatch to understand the context
4. **Determine initial response** based on severity:
   - Critical/High: Immediate investigation and remediation
   - Medium: Investigation during business hours
   - Low: Schedule for next maintenance window

**Triage Decision Tree:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Alert Received] --> B{User Impact?}
    B -->|Yes| C{Business Critical?}
    B -->|No| D{Performance Impact?}
    C -->|Yes| E[P1: Immediate Response]
    C -->|No| F[P2: Respond within SLA]
    D -->|Yes| G[P3: Investigate in Business Hours]
    D -->|No| H[P4: Schedule for Maintenance]
```

### Escalation Procedures

If the incident cannot be resolved by the initial responder, follow the escalation process:

**Escalation Path:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Automated Alert] --> B{Initial Response?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Incident Handler]
    B -->|No, 15min| D[Team Lead]
    
    C --> E{Resolved in SLA?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Resolution & Documentation]
    E -->|No| D
    
    D --> G{Resolved in SLA?}
    G -->|Yes| F
    G -->|No| H[Engineering Manager]
    
    H --> I{Business Impact?}
    I -->|High| J[Executive Escalation]
    I -->|Low/Medium| K[Extended Resolution Team]
    
    K --> F
    J --> F
```

**Escalation Time Frames:**

| Severity | Initial Response | First Escalation | Second Escalation |
|----------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Critical | 15 minutes | 30 minutes | 1 hour |
| High | 30 minutes | 1 hour | 2 hours |
| Medium | 2 hours | 4 hours | 8 hours |
| Low | Next business day | N/A | N/A |

**Escalation Contact Information:**

| Role | Contact Method | Hours |
|------|---------------|-------|
| On-call Engineer | PagerDuty (SMS + Phone) | 24/7 |
| Team Lead | PagerDuty (SMS + Phone) | 24/7 |
| Engineering Manager | PagerDuty (SMS), Phone | Business hours, On-call for critical |
| Executive | Phone | Critical incidents only |

### Incident Documentation

Proper documentation is essential for tracking incidents and improving response procedures.

**During the Incident:**

1. Create an incident ticket in the tracking system
2. Document ongoing investigation steps and findings
3. Record remediation actions taken
4. Update stakeholders on status and ETA

**Incident Documentation Template:**

```
## Incident Details
- Date/Time: [When incident began]
- Duration: [How long it lasted]
- Severity: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
- Services Affected: [List of affected services]
- Impact: [Description of user/business impact]

## Timeline
- [Timestamp] - [Event/Action]
- [Timestamp] - [Event/Action]
- [Timestamp] - Resolution

## Root Cause
[Description of what caused the incident]

## Resolution
[Description of how the incident was resolved]

## Action Items
- [Action item 1]
- [Action item 2]
```

### Post-Mortem Analysis

After an incident is resolved, conduct a post-mortem analysis to prevent recurrence:

**Post-Mortem Process:**

1. **Schedule a post-mortem meeting** (within 1-3 days of resolution)
2. **Prepare a detailed timeline** of the incident
3. **Identify root cause(s)** using techniques like 5 Whys
4. **Determine corrective actions** to prevent recurrence
5. **Assign ownership** for each action item
6. **Schedule follow-up** to verify implementation

**Post-Mortem Template:**

```

## Troubleshooting with Monitoring

Monitoring data is a valuable resource for troubleshooting issues in the system.

### Performance Issues

When troubleshooting performance problems:

1. **Identify the affected component**:
   - Check API response times by endpoint
   - Look for database query latency
   - Examine resource utilization (CPU, memory)

2. **Analyze patterns**:
   - Is the issue continuous or intermittent?
   - Does it correlate with specific time periods or load?
   - Is it isolated to specific components?

3. **Review recent changes**:
   - Deployments
   - Configuration changes
   - Database schema changes

**Common Performance Issues and Solutions:**

| Symptom | Possible Causes | Investigation Approach | Potential Solutions |
|---------|----------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| High API Response Time | Server load, Slow database queries, Resource constraints | Check CPU/memory, Review slow query logs, Check connection pools | Scale up resources, Optimize queries, Add caching |
