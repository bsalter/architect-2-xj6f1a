# Project Requirements

## Overview

The Interaction Management System is an interactive web application designed for managing and viewing Interaction records through a searchable table interface ("Finder") and a dedicated add/edit form. The system addresses the need for organizations to have a centralized, searchable system to track various interactions across multiple sites with controlled user access.

The system enables users to:
- Record, view, and manage interaction data with comprehensive field support
- Search and filter interactions through an intuitive interface
- Access interactions specific to their organizational site(s)
- Maintain data isolation between different organizational sites

Key stakeholders include site administrators, regular users tracking interactions, and management requiring interaction data analysis. The system provides value through streamlined interaction management with search capabilities, multi-site support, and secure user access control, simplifying organizational communication tracking.
