## Local Development Environment

### Docker Compose Setup

For local development, a Docker Compose configuration is provided that mimics the production environment:

1. Navigate to the project root directory
2. Start the local environment:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start the following services:
- PostgreSQL database (port 5432)
- Redis cache (port 6379)
- Backend API service (port 5000)
- Frontend development server with hot reloading (port 3000)

To stop the environment:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

To remove all data volumes and start fresh:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

### Local Database Setup

The Docker Compose setup automatically initializes the database with schema and seed data. To manually connect to the database:

```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL container
docker-compose exec db psql -U postgres interactions

# Run database migrations manually (if needed)
docker-compose exec api python -m alembic upgrade head

# Seed database with test data
docker-compose exec api python -m scripts.seed_database
```

### Connecting to Local Services

| Service | Local URL | Credentials/Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| Frontend | http://localhost:3000 | Auto-reloads on code changes |
| Backend API | http://localhost:5000 | Swagger UI: http://localhost:5000/docs |
| PostgreSQL | localhost:5432 | Username: postgres, Password: postgres |
| Redis | localhost:6379 | No authentication in development |

## Terraform Deployment

### Terraform Structure

The Terraform configuration follows a modular approach to enable reuse and separation of concerns:

- **Modules**: Reusable components defining specific infrastructure resources
- **Environments**: Environment-specific configurations leveraging modules
- **Global**: Resources shared across all environments

### Deployment Workflow

To deploy the infrastructure using Terraform:

1. Navigate to the appropriate environment directory:

```bash
cd infrastructure/terraform/environments/dev  # For development environment
```

2. Initialize Terraform:

```bash
terraform init
```

3. Plan the deployment:

```bash
terraform plan -out=tfplan
```

4. Review the plan to ensure it matches expected changes

5. Apply the changes:

```bash
terraform apply tfplan
```

For automated deployments, use the deployment script:

```bash
../../scripts/deploy.sh dev  # Deploy to development
```

### Environment Configuration

Environment-specific configuration is managed through Terraform variables defined in `terraform.tfvars` files within each environment directory. Key configuration variables include:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `environment` | Environment name | `"dev"`, `"staging"`, `"prod"` |
| `aws_region` | AWS region for deployment | `"us-east-1"` |
| `vpc_cidr` | VPC CIDR block | `"10.0.0.0/16"` |
| `azs` | List of availability zones | `["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b"]` |
| `rds_instance_type` | RDS instance size | `"db.t3.medium"` |
| `ecs_task_cpu` | CPU units for ECS tasks | `1024` (1 vCPU) |
| `ecs_task_memory` | Memory for ECS tasks | `2048` (2 GB) |
| `min_capacity` | Min number of ECS tasks | `2` |
| `max_capacity` | Max number of ECS tasks | `6` |

To modify environment configuration:

1. Edit the appropriate `terraform.tfvars` file
2. Plan and apply the changes as described above

### Secrets Management

Sensitive information is managed through AWS Secrets Manager and AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store:

- **Secrets Manager**: Database credentials, API keys
- **Parameter Store**: Configuration values, non-sensitive settings

To create or update a secret:

```bash
# Create a new secret
aws secretsmanager create-secret \
    --name "/interactions/prod/db-credentials" \
    --description "Production database credentials" \
    --secret-string '{"username":"dbadmin","password":"example-password"}'

# Update an existing secret
aws secretsmanager update-secret \
    --secret-id "/interactions/prod/db-credentials" \
    --secret-string '{"username":"dbadmin","password":"new-password"}'
```

Secrets are referenced in Terraform using the `aws_secretsmanager_secret_version` data source and passed to resources that require them.

## Continuous Deployment

### GitHub Actions Setup

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous deployment of infrastructure changes. Workflows are defined in `.github/workflows/`:

- `infrastructure-ci.yml`: Validates Terraform configurations on pull requests
- `infrastructure-cd-dev.yml`: Deploys changes to the development environment
- `infrastructure-cd-staging.yml`: Deploys changes to the staging environment
- `infrastructure-cd-prod.yml`: Deploys changes to the production environment

The workflows are triggered based on the following events:

| Workflow | Trigger |
|----------|---------|
| Infrastructure CI | Pull requests to main branch |
| Dev Deployment | Push to main branch |
| Staging Deployment | Manual trigger or scheduled (nightly) |
| Production Deployment | Manual approval only |

### Environment Promotion

Changes follow a promotion path through environments:

1. Changes are first deployed to the development environment automatically when merged to main
2. After testing, changes are manually promoted to staging using the GitHub Actions workflow
3. Production deployment requires manual approval from an authorized team member

This process ensures that infrastructure changes are thoroughly tested before reaching production.

### Deployment Verification

After each deployment, automated verification checks are performed:

1. **Health Checks**: Verify that all services are healthy
2. **Functionality Tests**: Basic API tests to confirm application is working
3. **CloudWatch Alarms**: Verification that no alarms are triggered by the deployment

Manual verification steps for critical deployments:

1. Verify database connectivity
2. Check cache operation
3. Validate that frontend assets are being served correctly
4. Test authentication flow
5. Confirm monitoring dashboards are receiving metrics

## Containerization

### Docker Image Strategy

The application is containerized using Docker with the following image strategy:

| Component | Base Image | Build Context |
|-----------|------------|--------------|
| Frontend | `node:18-alpine` | `/frontend` directory |
| Backend API | `python:3.11-slim` | `/backend` directory |

Images are tagged using the following format:
```
{component}-{semantic_version}-{environment}-{git_short_hash}
Example: frontend-1.2.3-prod-a7b3c9d
```

To build images locally:

```bash
# Build frontend image
docker build -f infrastructure/docker/Dockerfile.frontend -t interactions-frontend:latest ./frontend

# Build backend image
docker build -f infrastructure/docker/Dockerfile.backend -t interactions-backend:latest ./backend
```

### Amazon ECS Configuration

The application is deployed on Amazon ECS with Fargate for serverless container management:

- **Cluster**: Environment-specific ECS cluster (e.g., `interactions-prod`)
- **Services**: Separate services for frontend and backend components
- **Task Definitions**: CPU and memory allocations based on environment needs
- **Service Discovery**: App Mesh for service-to-service communication

Key ECS parameters by environment:

| Parameter | Development | Staging | Production |
|-----------|------------|---------|------------|
| Frontend CPU | 0.5 vCPU | 1 vCPU | 1 vCPU |
| Frontend Memory | 1 GB | 2 GB | 2 GB |
| Backend CPU | 1 vCPU | 1 vCPU | 2 vCPU |
| Backend Memory | 2 GB | 2 GB | 4 GB |
| Min Instances | 1 | 2 | 2 |
| Max Instances | 2 | 4 | 6 |

### Container Scaling Policies

ECS services are configured with auto-scaling policies based on the following metrics:

| Metric | Scale Out Threshold | Scale In Threshold | Cooldown |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|----------|
| CPU Utilization | > 70% for 3 minutes | < 40% for 10 minutes | 300 seconds |
| Memory Utilization | > 80% for 3 minutes | < 50% for 10 minutes | 300 seconds |
| Request Count | > 1000 req/min for 3 minutes | < 500 req/min for 10 minutes | 300 seconds |

Target tracking scaling policies are defined in Terraform:

```hcl
resource "aws_appautoscaling_policy" "cpu_policy" {
  name               = "${var.environment}-cpu-policy"
  policy_type        = "TargetTrackingScaling"
  resource_id        = aws_appautoscaling_target.ecs_target.resource_id
  scalable_dimension = aws_appautoscaling_target.ecs_target.scalable_dimension
  service_namespace  = aws_appautoscaling_target.ecs_target.service_namespace

  target_tracking_scaling_policy_configuration {
    predefined_metric_specification {
      predefined_metric_type = "ECSServiceAverageCPUUtilization"
    }
    target_value       = 70.0
    scale_in_cooldown  = 300
    scale_out_cooldown = 300
  }
}
```

## Database Management

### RDS Configuration

The PostgreSQL database is deployed using Amazon RDS with the following configuration:

| Parameter | Development | Staging | Production |
|-----------|------------|---------|------------|
| Instance Type | db.t3.small | db.t3.medium | db.t3.large |
| Storage | 20 GB | 50 GB | 100 GB |
| Storage Type | gp2 | gp2 | gp3 |
| Multi-AZ | No | Yes | Yes |
| Backup Retention | 7 days | 14 days | 30 days |
| Maintenance Window | Sun 03:00-04:00 UTC | Sun 04:00-05:00 UTC | Sun 05:00-06:00 UTC |

Key PostgreSQL parameter group settings:

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| `max_connections` | 200 | Increased from default 100 |
| `shared_buffers` | 25% of available memory | Optimized for workload |
| `effective_cache_size` | 75% of available memory | Optimized for workload |
| `work_mem` | 64MB | For complex query operations |
| `maintenance_work_mem` | 256MB | For maintenance operations |
| `autovacuum` | on | Automatic vacuum processing |

### Backup Strategy

Database backups are managed through a combination of automated RDS snapshots and point-in-time recovery:

- **Automated Snapshots**: Taken daily during the backup window
- **Transaction Logs**: Continuously archived for point-in-time recovery
- **Manual Snapshots**: Taken before major updates or changes

For manual backup operations, use the backup script:

```bash
# Create a manual snapshot
./scripts/backup.sh create-snapshot prod interactions-pre-migration

# Verify recent backups
./scripts/backup.sh list-backups prod
```

### Database Maintenance

Regular maintenance tasks include:

1. **Version Updates**: PostgreSQL minor version updates applied quarterly
2. **Parameter Tuning**: Performance optimization based on CloudWatch metrics
3. **Index Maintenance**: Reindex operations for heavily fragmented indexes

To apply a minor version update:

1. Create a manual snapshot as backup
2. Schedule the update through the RDS console or Terraform
3. Monitor the update progress and verify application functionality afterward

## Caching Architecture

### ElastiCache Setup

The Redis caching layer is deployed using Amazon ElastiCache with the following configuration:

| Parameter | Development | Staging | Production |
|-----------|------------|---------|------------|
| Node Type | cache.t3.small | cache.t3.medium | cache.m5.large |
| Number of Nodes | 1 | 2 | 2 |
| Multi-AZ | No | Yes | Yes |
| Automatic Failover | Disabled | Enabled | Enabled |
| Encryption | At-rest | At-rest & In-transit | At-rest & In-transit |

The Redis cluster is used for:
- API response caching
- Session management
- Rate limiting counters
- Search results caching

### Cache Optimization

For optimal cache usage:

1. **TTL Strategy**: Different expiration times based on data volatility
   - Authentication tokens: 24 hours
   - Search results: 5 minutes
   - Reference data: 1 hour

2. **Memory Management**:
   - `maxmemory` policy set to `volatile-lru` (evict keys with TTL using LRU)
   - Memory usage alarms set at 75% and 90%

3. **Key Naming Conventions**:
   - Use prefixes to identify data type (e.g., `search:`, `auth:`, `user:`)
   - Include site context in keys to maintain multi-tenant isolation

## Static Asset Management

### S3 Bucket Configuration

Static frontend assets are stored in Amazon S3 with the following configuration:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Bucket Policy | Public read for CloudFront, blocked direct access |
| Encryption | Server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed keys |
| Versioning | Enabled |
| Lifecycle Rules | Remove previous versions after 30 days |

The S3 bucket structure follows:

```
s3://interactions-{environment}-assets/
├── static/                # Static assets
│   ├── css/               # Stylesheets
│   ├── js/                # JavaScript files
│   ├── images/            # Image assets
│   └── fonts/             # Font files
├── build/                 # Current build artifacts
└── releases/              # Previous releases (for rollback)
    ├── v1.0.0/            # Version-specific builds
    ├── v1.1.0/
    └── ...
```

### CloudFront Distribution

The CloudFront CDN is configured with:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Price Class | PriceClass_100 (US, Canada, Europe) |
| SSL Certificate | ACM certificate for custom domain |
| HTTPS Redirect | Yes |
| Cache Policy | CachingOptimized |
| Origin Shield | Enabled in primary AWS region |
| Default TTL | 1 day |

Cache behaviors are configured for optimal performance:

| Path Pattern | Cache TTL | Compression | Notes |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| `/static/*` | 1 year | Enabled | Long-lived static assets |
| `/build/*` | 1 day | Enabled | Current build artifacts |
| `index.html` | No caching | Enabled | Always serve latest version |

### Asset Deployment Process

To deploy frontend assets:

1. Build the production assets:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

2. Upload to S3 and invalidate CloudFront cache:
```bash
./scripts/deploy-frontend.sh prod
```

The deployment script handles:
- Copying assets to S3
- Setting appropriate content types and cache headers
- Creating a timestamped release folder
- Invalidating the CloudFront cache

## Monitoring and Alerting

The following dashboards are configured in CloudWatch:

1. **Operations Dashboard**: Infrastructure health and resource utilization
   - ECS service status and scaling events
   - RDS performance metrics (CPU, memory, connections)
   - ElastiCache performance (CPU, memory, hit rate)
   - ALB metrics (request count, latency, 5xx errors)

2. **Application Dashboard**: Application performance and errors
   - API endpoint performance
   - Error rates by endpoint
   - User authentication metrics
   - Search/query performance

3. **Database Dashboard**: Detailed database performance
   - Query performance statistics
   - Connection pool utilization
   - Slow query analysis
   - Storage utilization and growth trends

To access dashboards:
1. Open the AWS Console
2. Navigate to CloudWatch → Dashboards
3. Select the appropriate dashboard

### Alert Configuration

Alert notifications are routed to:
- **Critical/High**: Primary on-call engineer via PagerDuty
- **Medium**: Engineering team Slack channel
- **Low**: Engineering email distribution list

### Log Management

Application and infrastructure logs are centralized in CloudWatch Logs:

| Log Group | Source | Retention |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| `/aws/ecs/interactions-{env}-backend` | Backend API | 30 days |
| `/aws/ecs/interactions-{env}-frontend` | Frontend server | 30 days |
| `/aws/rds/instance/{instance-id}` | RDS logs | 14 days |
| `/aws/elasticache/interactions-{env}` | ElastiCache logs | 14 days |
| `/aws/lambda/interactions-{env}-tasks` | Lambda functions | 30 days |

Log groups are configured with:
- Structured logging in JSON format
- Log insights enabled for advanced querying
- Metric filters for key operational events
- Subscription filters for critical events (optional)

## Security

### Network Security

The network is secured using a defense-in-depth approach:

| Component | Configuration |
|-----------|---------------|
| VPC | Isolated environment with private and public subnets |
| Security Groups | Restrictive inbound/outbound rules based on service needs |
| NACLs | Additional subnet-level controls |
| AWS WAF | Protection against common web exploits (OWASP Top 10) |
| AWS Shield | DDoS protection |

Key security group rules:
- ALB: Inbound 80/443 from internet, outbound to ECS containers only
- ECS: Inbound from ALB only, outbound to RDS and ElastiCache
- RDS: Inbound from ECS on PostgreSQL port only
- ElastiCache: Inbound from ECS on Redis port only

### Data Encryption

All sensitive data is encrypted:

| Data Type | Encryption Method |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Data in Transit | TLS 1.2+ for all communications |
| RDS Data | AWS RDS encryption with KMS |
| ElastiCache Data | Encryption at rest with KMS |
| S3 Objects | Server-side encryption with S3-managed keys |
| Secrets | AWS Secrets Manager with KMS |

### IAM Policies

IAM roles follow the principle of least privilege:

| Role | Purpose | Key Permissions |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `interactions-ecs-execution` | ECS task execution | ECR pull, CloudWatch Logs |
| `interactions-ecs-task` | ECS task runtime | S3 read, Parameter Store read |
| `interactions-ci-cd` | Deployment automation | ECS deploy, S3 write, CloudWatch read |
| `interactions-monitoring` | Monitoring service | CloudWatch full access |

### Security Monitoring

Security events are monitored and logged:

| Security Aspect | Monitoring |
|-----------------|------------|
| Authentication | Failed login attempts, token validation failures |
| Authorization | Access denied events, elevation attempts |
| Network | VPC Flow Logs analysis, unusual traffic patterns |
| Data Access | Database query logging, sensitive data access |

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup and Restore

Disaster recovery procedures are based on comprehensive backups:

| Component | Backup Method | Recovery Procedure |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Database | RDS automated backups | Point-in-time recovery or snapshot restore |
| ElastiCache | Redis backup (snapshot) | Restore from backup file |
| ECS Services | Container images in ECR | Deploy from last stable image |
| Static Assets | S3 versioning | Restore previous version |
| Infrastructure | Terraform state | Rebuild from Terraform code |

### Failover Procedures

Automated failover is configured for:
- RDS Multi-AZ deployment for database failover
- ElastiCache Multi-AZ with automatic failover
- ECS services distributed across multiple AZs

Manual failover procedures are documented for:
- Region failure (requires manual intervention)
- Full database restoration

### Recovery Testing

Disaster recovery procedures are tested regularly:
- Monthly: RDS point-in-time recovery test
- Quarterly: Full application restore test
- Bi-annually: Multi-AZ failover simulation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Infrastructure Issues

| Issue | Symptoms | Resolution |
|-------|----------|------------|
| ECS Service Deployment Failure | Tasks not starting, deployment stuck | Check task definition compatibility, review CloudWatch Logs |
| Database Connection Issues | API errors, connection timeouts | Verify security group rules, check connection pool settings |
| ElastiCache Evictions | Cache miss rate increases | Increase node size, review memory usage patterns |
| CloudFront Caching Issues | Stale content, new deployments not visible | Check cache settings, perform invalidation |
| RDS High CPU | Slow queries, timeouts | Review query performance, check for missing indexes |

### Diagnostic Procedures

For general infrastructure issues:

1. Check service health dashboards
2. Review CloudWatch Logs for errors
3. Verify recent deployments or changes
4. Check AWS service health dashboard for regional issues
5. Review security group and network configurations

Database performance troubleshooting:

1. Check RDS Performance Insights
2. Review slow query logs
3. Examine connection count and active sessions
4. Verify index usage with explain plans

### Support Escalation

For issues requiring additional support:

1. Internal escalation path:
   - L1: DevOps Engineer on call
   - L2: Infrastructure Team Lead
   - L3: Engineering Manager

2. AWS Support escalation:
   - Create case in AWS Support Center
   - Include account ID, resources affected, and diagnostic information
   - Select appropriate severity level based on impact
