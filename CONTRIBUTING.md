### Development Workflow

To contribute effectively, follow this development workflow:

1.  **Create a branch:** Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix. Use a descriptive name with the appropriate prefix:

    -   `feature/`: For new features
    -   `bugfix/`: For bug fixes
    -   `hotfix/`: For urgent fixes

4.  **Push to your fork:** Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/amazing-feature
    ```
5.  **Submit a pull request:** Create a pull request from your branch to the main repository's `main` branch.

### Coding Standards

To maintain a consistent codebase, please adhere to the following coding standards:

*   **Frontend:**
    *   Use TypeScript for all new code.
    *   Follow React best practices for component structure and state management.
    *   Utilize TailwindCSS for styling and maintain a consistent UI.
*   **Backend:**
    *   Write Python code that is compliant with PEP 8.
    *   Use Flask and SQLAlchemy patterns for API development and database interactions.
*   **Linting and formatting:**
    *   Use ESLint and Prettier for frontend code.
    *   Use Pylint and Black for backend code.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Document all code with JSDoc or docstrings.
    *   Provide clear and concise explanations of code functionality.

### Testing Requirements

We require comprehensive testing for all contributions:

*   **Unit tests:** Write unit tests for all new code, aiming for at least 80% coverage.
*   **Integration tests:** Implement integration tests to verify interactions between different components.
*   **End-to-end tests:** Create end-to-end tests to ensure that the application functions correctly from a user perspective.
*   **Run tests locally:** Before submitting a pull request, run all tests locally to ensure that your changes do not introduce any regressions.
*   **CI/CD:** The CI/CD pipeline will automatically run all tests upon submission of a pull request.

### Pull Request Process

To submit your changes, follow this pull request process:

1.  **Create a pull request:** Submit a pull request from your branch to the main repository's `main` branch.
2.  **Fill out the pull request template:** Provide all the necessary information in the pull request template, including a clear description of the changes, related issues, and testing details.
3.  **Code review:** Your pull request will be reviewed by project maintainers. Address any feedback and make necessary changes.
4.  **CI/CD checks:** Ensure that all CI/CD checks pass.
5.  **Merge:** Once your pull request is approved and all checks pass, it will be merged into the `main` branch.

*   **Bug report:** Use the [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) to report a bug.
*   **Feature request:** Use the [feature request template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) to suggest a new feature or enhancement.

Before creating a new issue, please search for existing issues to avoid duplicates. Provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue, expected behavior, and actual behavior.

### Documentation

We value clear and comprehensive documentation. When contributing code, please ensure that you update the documentation accordingly:

*   **Code documentation:** Use JSDoc for frontend code and docstrings for backend code.
